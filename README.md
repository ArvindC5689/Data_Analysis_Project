## BSES (Batter Situational Efficiency Stat)
 The BSES stat is a stat that is designed to evaluate both performance while taking the situation into account.

Other stats like BA or SLG or OBP evaluate performance, but they do not take into account what the situation was when the batter was at bat. In some situations, RBIs and the ability to hit become much more important. For example if the score is 14-0 at the top of the 2nd or 3rd inning and a batter for the winning team hits a home run, that home run is not really that impactful, since the the score deficit was already so large. On the other hand if the score is tied and its the bottom of the 10th inning and a team hits a home run, that home run is much more important because it won the game. Both of these situations are very different, however stats like BA or SLG or OBP treat each of these scenarios exactly the same. This might miake for some misleading evaluations of players. This is the problem that BSES tries to eliminate. 
  
BSES is an event based stat. What this means is that every time a batter is at the plate, he is assigned a numerical value at the end of that plate appearance. This value is calculated with 3 main parts: The Situation Factor, The RBI Efficiency and the Event Score. The formula for the
